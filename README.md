# CPP-Logic-gate-game
The Logic Gates Game, is designed to educate users about various logic gates and their functions while incorporating the concepts of Data File Handling and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). The game is developed using the C++ programming language.

The primary objective of the game is to provide an interactive learning experience about logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NOR, etc. Users can explore the functionality of these gates through a series of challenges and puzzles. By solving these challenges, users gain a practical understanding of how logic gates work and their role in digital circuits.

To access the game, users are required to create an account. The account details and progress of each user are stored in binary files, ensuring the persistence of their data. This allows users to track their progress and continue from where they left off in subsequent sessions. The data file handling mechanism ensures efficient storage and retrieval of user information, enhancing the overall user experience.

The game is based on the truth table concept, where users are presented with logical statements and are required to apply the appropriate logic gate to determine the output. Users can evaluate their performance and check their scores, providing them with feedback on their understanding of logic gates. This scoring mechanism encourages users to improve their knowledge and strive for higher scores.

The tech-stack used in developing the Logic Gates Game is C++, a powerful and versatile programming language. The object-oriented nature of C++ allows for the implementation of classes and objects, enabling efficient organization and management of the game's components. The game leverages OOPs concepts to encapsulate logic gates as objects, facilitating code reusability and modular design.

Overall, the Logic Gates Game developed during the mentioned period serves as an educational tool for users to learn about logic gates through an interactive and engaging gameplay experience. The utilization of data file handling and OOPs concepts, along with the tech-stack of C++, contributes to the effectiveness and functionality of the game.
